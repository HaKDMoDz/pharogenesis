	"The given form has been externalized before. If it was reasonably compressed, use the bits of the original data - this allows us to recycle GIF, JPEG, PNG etc. data without using the internal compression (which is in most cases inferior). If necessary the data will be retrieved from its URL location. This retrieval is done only if the resouce comes from either
		* the local disk (in which case the file has never been published)
		* the browser cache (in which case we don't cache the resource locally)
	In any other case we will *not* attempt to retrieve it, because doing so can cause the system to connect to the network which is probably not what we want. It should be a rare case anyways; could only happen if one clears the squeak cache selectively."
