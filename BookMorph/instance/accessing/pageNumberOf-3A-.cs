	"Modified so that if the page IS in memory, other pages don't have to be brought in.  (This method may wrongly say a page is not here if pages has a tombstone (MorphObjectOut) and that tombstone would resolve to an object already in this image.  This is an unlikely case, and callers just have to tolerate it.)"
