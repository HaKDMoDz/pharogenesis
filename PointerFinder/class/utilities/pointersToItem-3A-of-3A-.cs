pointersToItem: index of: anArray
	"Find all occurrences in the system of pointers to the given element of the given array. 
	This is useful for tracing up a pointer chain from an inspector on the results of a previous 	call of pointersTo:. To find out who points to the second element of the results, one would 	evaluate:

		PointerFinder pointersToItem: 2 of: self

	in the inspector."
