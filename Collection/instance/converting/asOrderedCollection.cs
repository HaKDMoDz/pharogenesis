asOrderedCollection
	"Answer an OrderedCollection whose elements are the elements of the
	receiver. The order in which elements are added depends on the order
	in which the receiver enumerates its elements. In the case of unordered
	collections, the ordering is not necessarily the same for multiple 
	requests for the conversion."
